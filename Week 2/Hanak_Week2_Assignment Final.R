# With the data frame you created last week you will:

# Create a barplot for one numeric column, grouped by the character vector with 3 unique values
  # Add error bars with mean and standard deviation to the plot
  # Change the x and y labels and add a title
  # Export the plot as a PDF that is 4 inches wide and 7 inches tall.

# Create a scatter plot between two of your numeric columns.
  # Change the point shape and color to something NOT used in the example.
  # Change the x and y labels and add a title
  # Export the plot as a JPEG by using the "Export" button in the plotting pane.

# Upload both plots with the script used to create them to GitHub.
  # Follow the same file naming format as last week for the script.
  # Name plots as Lastname_barplot or Lastname_scatterplot. Save them to your "plots" folder.
