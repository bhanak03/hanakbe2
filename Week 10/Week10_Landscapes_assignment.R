# Load the packages from this week's tutorial.
#In the tutorial we looked at the community as a whole and the swimmers which ultimately matched a prediction we had for their distribution.

#Part 1: Look at two other subsets of the community and determine the relative influence of space and habitat on each following the methods in the tutorial. (10 points)
#The options include groupings by taxonomy, where Diptera (true flies) have the strongest flight ability, Trichoptera the 2nd strongest, 
    #Ephememeroptera are 3rd, and non insects are 4th...because they don't have wings.
#Groupings by habits include the swimmers (off limits for the assignment) as most mobile, sprawlers as 2nd (they move in search of food, but not quickly),
    #and the clingers come in last (they might move up and down on individual rocks).

#Part 2: What is your interpretation of the pattern for each group individually, and the two in comparison, based on their mobility? (5 points)

#For Caddisflies, they are explained mostly by habitat and not space. This makes sense because they range in mobility as larvae, although the adults can fly. The space
#doesn't matter because of this range, but this range of motions can still exist in similar/the same habitats.
#For Clingers, habitat also matters more than space. This is because they are clinging to rocks, unmoving mostly, so space is not influenced unless they were to be stacked
#on top of each other. Habitat matters because the environment in which they live needs to be suitable for their species.
#Together, the habitat only explanation makes sense due to the diverse nature of caddisfly movement (which would be the thing to specify space) but their 
#relative dependability to be in freshwater sediment.

#Part 3: For each of your chosen groups of bugs, perform variable selection for the habitat data rather than the AEM data. Which habitat variables are significant for each? (10 points)
  # Definitions for the habitat column names:
    #Inorg = total suspended inorganic solids in the water column
    #Organ = total suspended organic solids in the water column
    #Chla = Chlorophyll a concentration from benthic rocks collected in-stream
    #BOM = total benthic organic matter in the sample
    #Depth = water depth
    #Flow	= water velocity where samples were collected
    #Fines = Percent of the substrate as "fines" i.e. small particles too small to measure
    #AveAr = The average size of rocks where each sample was collected

#In the clingers data set, depth and chlorophyll concentration are significant. In Triphs, nothing is
#significant.

#Part 4: How do you expect selecting both the spatial and the habitat variables would change the results of the RDAs from Part 1 above? (5 points)
  #(You do not need to redo the RDAs, unless you *want* to.)

#I think that if you looked at the spatial and habitat data sets together you would see similar results to the separate RDAs, specifically
#because space had such low influence on both Clingers and Triph. In addition, I specified above why space was less important than habitat for 
#both groups: clingers don't move and caddisflies have a variety of movement types and the adults are flying around the real world where space 
#isn't super important. If I had to estimate which set would have more reuslts from incorporating space, I would however chose Caddisflies due to
#their varied movement.
