# Now it is time to create your own data frame using the tools we have learned this week.
# First, resave this script as: your last name_Week1_Assignment
  # e.g. mine would be Wilson_Week1_Assignemnt


# Create 3 numeric vectors and 2 character vectors that are each 15 values in length with the following structures:
  # One character vector with all unique values
  # One character vector with exactly 3 unique values
  # One numeric vector with all unique values
  # One numeric vector with some repeated values (number of your choosing)
  # One numeric vector with some decimal values (of your choosing)

# Bind the vectors into a single data frame, rename the columns, and make the character vector with unique values the row names# 
# Remove the character vector with unique values from the data frame.

# Add 1 row with unique numeric values to the data frame.

# Export the data frame as a .csv file 

# Generate summary statistics of your data frame and copy them as text into your script under a new section heading.

# Push your script and your .csv file to GitHub in a new "Week1" folder.
