# (3) - By only changing values for alpha, beta, gamma, and/or delta
# change the default parameters of the L-V model to best approximate the relationship between Limncalanus and D.mendotae, assuming both plots are on the same time scale.
# What are the changes you've made to alpha, beta, gamma, and delta from the default values; and what do they say in a relative sense about the plankton data? (4 pts)
# Are there other paramenter changes that could have created the same end result? (2 pts)
# Export your final L-V plot with a legend that includes the appropriate genus and/or species name as if the model results were the real plankton data, 
# and upload with your script. (hint - remember which one is the predator and which is the prey)
